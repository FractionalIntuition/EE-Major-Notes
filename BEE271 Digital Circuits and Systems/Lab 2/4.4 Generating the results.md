## Invert all the subtrahend bits, on a bit-by-bit basis
## The carry inputs should be 1 if there is no 'borrow'
- Carry out of a 0 implies a "borrow"
- If this is a multiple precision subtraction, this will make more significant subtraction results smaller = a borrow
Consult textbook section 3.3.3 & figure 3.12.
This operation involves a simple multiplexer:
- if $ALUC[0] = 0, result = a+b$ 
- if $ALUC[0] = 1, result = a-b$
