A complete ALU has a large number of possible control inputs on a complete ALU.
- Shift
- Rotate
- Compare
- Multiplty
- Divide
- Etc....

The operations we're using derived from having only two switches, being $SW[9:8]$ - ALU8 Control codes Table 1.

| Operation | ALU Control bits | Status effects | Operation & System Verilog Syntax |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ADD | 00 | N, Z, C, V | A+B, Carry-out |
| SUB | 01 | N, Z, C, V | A-B, borrow (~C) out |
| AND | 10 | N, Z | Logical AND (A&B) |
| OR | 11 | N, Z | Logical OR (A\|B) |
