### The XOR-gate would be our adder
The adder is essentially a XOR-gate

## XNor output values are the same
Lightswitches on either ends of the rooms are essentially XOR gates
If A = B, then do this

### Propagation Delay does not; ideally
### Propagation Delay can be measured through an Oscilloscope

# CMOS
### Complementary Metal Oxide silicon
Circuits that are built from
- N-Type Mosfet Transistor
- P-Type Mosfet Transistor
	- Holes behave as if they were electrons with a positive charge
**Voltage Controlled Resistor**
#### Mosfet
- A digitally controlled potentiometer

CMOS - Resistance path to ground and a high resistance path to +V
- Output of the gate is a logic 0
As Vin becomes more negative (logic 0)

When combined implement a NOT-gate
