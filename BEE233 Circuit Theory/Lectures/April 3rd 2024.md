### Over Inductor

## Over Capacitor

## Over Resistor

## Over Impedance (Z)
Is it reactance or impedance?

## The relationship between Voltage & Current
### Over a resistor they are in-phase
- There is on difference in phase-shift to these two sinusoidal waves
### Over a inductor
- #### v(t) leads i(t) by 90$\degree$
- $X_L=jwl(\ohm)=wL*90\degree$
### Over a capacitor
- #### i(t) leads v(t) by 90$\degree$
- $X_C=\frac{1}{jwc}=-\frac{j}{wc}(\ohm)=\frac{}$
## Leading
- Definition:
	- Is when the voltage *starts* before the other sinusoidal graphs

## Basere Advice
- Whenever you have to analyse a circuit, you have to draw out each step
![[Pasted image 20240403162429.png]]
- Every ideal electronic component has two ends
- Every connection for parallel in an ideal setting will have terminal 1 and terminal 2 become connected

#### When frequency is unavailable
- We use
	- f = 1Khz
- Another student
	- f = 5Khz
The frequency you use for the conversion between frequency-domain to time-domain, you must use the same frequency when switching back
![[Pasted image 20240403164431.png]]
When we want to simulate the above completed circuit for the second example, we can still find the time-domain conversion;
"EASY" - Basere
- We just pick a frequency; just choose one

#### Parallel Conditions:
- The connections are the same from both ends
