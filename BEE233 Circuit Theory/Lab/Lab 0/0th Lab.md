$f = \frac{1}{T}$
$T = f^{-1}$
$f = 2000kHz$
$T = 5ms$

$Divisions= 2$
$Amplitude = 500mV$
$Divisions*Amplitude = 1V_p$

**Do your estimates and the measurements agree with function generator settings?**

Yes.

# Lab 0-2

**Measure the difference between $\Delta t$:** 240$\mu s$
**Which channel is "leading" and which channel is "lagging":**
- Leading: Channel 1 (Yellow)
- Lagging: Channel 2 (Blue)

**Does this agree with the function generator phase settings:** Yes
$\frac{240\mu s}{1000\mu s}*360\degree = 86.4\degree$

# Lab 0-3
***The peak-to-peak amplitude ($V_{pp}$) that is displayed on the oscilloscope is not the same as the one programmed into the function generator? Why not?***
**Hint: What is the impedance of the input?**
