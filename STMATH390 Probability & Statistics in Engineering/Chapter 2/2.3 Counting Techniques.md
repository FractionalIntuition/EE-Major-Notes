### Fundamental Counting Principle:
For a multi-stage experiment with n-stages.
Where 1st stage is $K_1$ outcomes
2nd "   " $K_2$ "   "
nth  "   " $K_n$ "   "
The total possible outcomes for the exp. is $\Sigma K_n$
# Example
Kate begins her 1st year in an online degree program the 1st semester she will randomly select one course from the following 4 subjects
- 8 English I sections
- 12 College Alg.
- 11 American History
- 5 Physical Sciences

##### i) How many different options are therefor Kate's schedule?
$(8)(12)(11)(5) = 5280$ Possible Options.

##### ii) Factorial
e.g. 5!
	(5)(4)(3)(2)(1) = 120
$n!=n(n-1) ... (3)(2)(1)$

a) Permutation (order is important)
$_nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
- e.g. $_5P_2=\frac{5!}{(5-2)!} = \frac{5!}{3!} = \frac{(5)(4)(3)(2)(1)}{(3)(2)(1)} = {20}$
b) Combination (order is not important)
 $_nC_r = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$
 - e.g. $5C_2 = \frac{5!}{(2!)(3!)}=\frac{(5)(4)(3!)}{(2)(1)(3!)} = \frac{20}{1} = 10$
 - Homework Example: $Combination: \frac{25}{5} = \frac{25!}{(5!)(20!)}$
# Example
(a) Given a group of 3 friends; Jack, Jim, Judy in how many 2 of your friends stand in a line for a movie ticket?
Order important
$_3P_2 = \frac{3!}{(3-2)!} = \frac{3!}{1!} = (3)(2) = 6$

(b) In had way 2 of your friends ride in a car together?
Order is not important
$3C_2=\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!}=\frac{(3)(2)(1)}{(2)(1)}=3$
# Example
You teach a class of 15 students. There are 6 boys and 9 girls.
(a) You pick 3 of them at random to make a committee, what is the probability that all members are girls.
- i) Consider the importance of order
	- e.g. No
- ii) Specify 'E'
	- e.g. E: Selecting girls
- iii) Specify 'S'
	- e.g. S: Whole class
- iv) How many ways can we select 3 girls out of 9
$N(E)=9C_3=...=84$
$N(5)=15C_3=...=455$
$P(Girls)=\frac{84}{455}=18.46\%$

(b) If you pick 3 of them at random to server in a committee with 3-positions: President, Treasurer, Secretary
$N(E)=9P_3=...=504$
$N(S)=15P_3=...=2730$
$P(Girls)=\frac{504}{2730}=18.46\%$
# Brain Teaser
TRUE OR FALSE
$\frac{mC_x}{nC_x} = \frac{mP_x}{nP_x}$
$x<m<n$

Prove its either a true or false proof.
To falsify:
- Give one example
To truth
- Take the equation, take the left, and match it to the right
