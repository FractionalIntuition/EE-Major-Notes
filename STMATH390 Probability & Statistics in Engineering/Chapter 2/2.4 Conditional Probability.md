P(E given F) = P(E|F) = $\frac{P(E\cap F)}{P(F)}$
- $P(F|E) = \frac{P(E\cap F)}{P(E)}$
	- $P(E\cap F) = P(E|F)*P(F)$
	- $P(E\cap F) = P(E|F)*P(E)$
		- $P(F|E)*P(E)=P(E|F)*P(F)$
If E and F are independent, then $P(F|E)=P(F)$ & $P(E|F) = P(E)$
- $P(E\cap F) = P(F)P(E)$
	- For calculation purposes, the above is the best to use
# Example
75% of applicants for a car loan at a particular bank are approved. Of those who are approved, 90% own a home, of those who are not approved, 40% owna  home.
One applicant is selected randomly, if the applicant owns a home, what is the probability of hsi/her application was accepted?

Solution: 
A: Appl is approved, NA: App is not approved
H: Applicant owns a home, NH: Applicants do not own a home

Summary:
$P(A) = 0.75$, $P(H|A)=0.9$, $P(H|NA)=0.4$

What's the probability of the applicant was accepted?
$P(A|H)=$![[Pasted image 20240407133822.png]]
