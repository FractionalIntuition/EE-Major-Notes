# The Basics
## Probability
- Can be thought of as
	- Symmetrical outcomes
	- Relative Frequencies
	- Subjective

## Probability Experiment
- An experiment whose results are determined by chance
## Outcome
- Any individual result that is possible in a probability experiment
	- E.g. flipping a count; the possible outcomes are Heads & Tails
		- These are the realm of possible results of outcome
## Sample Spaces
- Similar to stating the population
- It is all possible outcomes of a probability experiment
	- E.g. flipping a coin
		- S = [H, T]
## Events
- It is a subset of a sample space.
	- A sample space itself can even be an event
# Example
Consider the experiment of rolling a six-sided die.
### Find the sample space
- Collection of all possible outcomes in an experiment
- S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
### Scenario A: List the outcomes of the event
- E = {Rolling an Even #} = {2, 4, 6}
### Scenario B: List the outcomes of the event
- F = {Rolling a # less than 10} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} = 5
# Example 2
Consider the experiment in which a Coin B tossed and then a six-sided die is rolled

### What is the sample spaces
- S = {(H, 1), (H, 2), (H, 3), (H, 4), ... (H, 6), (T,1), (T, 2), ..., (T, 6)}
- $2_{Coin} * 6_{Dice} = 12_{Total Chances}$
### Next: How do I ask more advanced probability questions?
"We have to have rules!"
### Properties of probability
1. For any event E, 0 <= P(E) <= 1
2. For any sample space S, P(S) = 1
3. For the empty set $\phi$, P($\phi$) = 0
4. For an event E
	1. $E^c or E^1 is the complement of E$
	2. P(E) + P(E') = 1
5. For any two events E of E or F (E$U$F) is intern by P(E$U$F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E$\cap$F)
# Example 1
At a university 20% of students are freshmen, 3% of students are math major and 0.5% of the students are both freshmen and math majors. What s the probability of randomly choosing either a freshman or a math major.
- F: Freshman
- M: Math
$P(F) = 0.2$
$P(M) = 0.03$
$P(F\cap M)=0.005$
- $P(F\cup M) = P(F) + P(M) - P(F\cap M) = 0.2 + 0.03 - 0.005$
	- 0.225
# Example 2
Suppose that after a vote in the US senate on a proposed health care bill, the following table shows the breakdown of votes by party.
![[Pasted image 20240404113010.png]]
If you stop randomly a voting senator, what is the probability this senator either a republican or voted against the bill?
$P(R\cup D) = P(R)' + P(B) + P(C) - P(A\cap B) - P(B\cap C) - P(A\cap C) + P(A\cap B \cap C)$

### P(6)
If $\Sigma A_n$ are pairuse dijoint events, then p($\Sigma A_n$) = P($A_1$) + P($A_2$) + ... + P($A_n$)

OR

# Group Activity
Consider the experiment of flipping a coin 3 times.
- Let A: At least one head $X \geq 1$
- Let B: At most 2 heads $X \leq 2$

a) List the outcomes of A & B
- A = {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH}
- B = {HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}
![[Pasted image 20240404113806.png]]
b) P(A), P(B), P(A'), P(B')
$P(A)=\frac{7}{8}$
$P(B) = \frac{7}{8}$
$P(A') = \frac{1}{8}$
$P(B') = \frac{1}{8}$

c) List the outcomes of $A\cup B$ and $A\cap B$

$(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)$
s = {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}
$P(A\cap B)$$
s = {HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH}
![[Pasted image 20240404115600.png]]

d) Find
i) $P(A\cap B)'$ = {HHH}
ii) $P(A\cup B)'$ = $\frac{7}{8}$
