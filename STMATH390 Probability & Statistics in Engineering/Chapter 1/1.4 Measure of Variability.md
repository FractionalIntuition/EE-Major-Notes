"Watch the smallest and the largest, and then take the data-points to a set"
### Max(imum) - Min(imum)
## Vanance
Not quite our focus
## Standard Deviation
### Are we dealing with sample or population?
#### Sample
- $s^2 = \frac{\Sigma (x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$
	- If the score is above the mean, it becomes positive
	- If the score is negative, then it becomes negative
	- Take the score of the mean, and then subtract the average, then divide by $n-1$
### Population
- $\sigma ^2 = \frac{\Sigma(x_i - \mu)^2}{N}$
### Sample
- $s = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$
### Population
- $\sigma ^2 = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma (X_i - \mu)^2}{N}}$
## Coefficient of Variation
### Sample
- $\frac{s}{x}*100\%$
### Population
- $\frac{\sigma}{\mu}*100\%$
## Percental: p%
### Ex:
- S{13, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10 , 123}
	- n = 9
	- 1st value = 13
	- 9th value = 123
- $l = n * \frac{p\%}{100}$
	- e.g. $50\% = \frac{50}{100}$
#### Median: 50%
- $9*\frac{50}{100} = 9*\frac{1}{2} = 4.5 \approx 5$
	- If its a decimal, round-up
	- If its a whole #, take the next square
		- next whole #
	- The average of the two squares that share the percentage between the two whole number values
#### What is the $P_{th}$ percental of the score 5.
- $P\% = \frac{l}{n}*100 = \frac{3}{9}*100 = \frac{1}{3}*100 \approx 33.\overline{333}\%$
