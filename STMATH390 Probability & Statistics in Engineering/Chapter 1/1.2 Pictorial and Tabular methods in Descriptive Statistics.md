| Class | 10 - 19 | 20 - 19 | 30 - 39 |     |     |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --- | --- |
| freq. | 5       | 3       | 7       |     |     |
You try to find the data that belongs to each class, and write the frequency of the data of each data for each respective set.

This is what we regard as a frequency table. \[State above]

| Class          | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | Total    |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | -------- |
| Frequency      | 10  | 5   | 15  | 20  | 50       |
| Relative Freq. | .2  | 0.5 | .15 | .4  | 1 (100%) |
| Accuracy Freq  | 10  | 15  | 30  | 50  |          |
Relative frequency: $\frac{10;Frequency}{50;Classtotal}$
Accuracy frequency: $\Sigma n_{class}$

### Pie chart
#### One of the most useful way to display data
![[Pasted image 20240328112356.png]]
### Bar Graph
#### Qualitative displays of data
"It uses bars to describe what it is in what we're talking about"
- Bars with spaces inbetween them

### Histogram
#### Quantitative displays of data
- Bars without spaces inbetween them
![[Pasted image 20240328112651.png]]
### Stem-leaf Plot
- The data starts, not at zero, but instead the lowest value of the dataset that is available to you
- The label is actually apart of the data rather than a descriptor of the data

### Qualitative vs Quantitative Data
#### Qualitative
One of the data represented
#### Quantitative
Description of data
## Levels of measurement
### Nominal
- Qualitative
	- Arbitrarily ordered
		- Labels
		- Names
		- e.g. Alphanumerical
### Ordinal
- Qualitative
	- Intentionally ordered
		- Labels
		- Names
### Interval
- Quantitative
	- Ordered
		- Difference has meaning
### Ratio
- Quantitative
	- Ordered
		- Difference has meanings
		- "0" has a meaning
