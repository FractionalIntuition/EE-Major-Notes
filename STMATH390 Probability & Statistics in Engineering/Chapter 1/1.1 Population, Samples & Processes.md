	- A numerical description of the population characteristics
		- The annual income is 50k - the 50k is the parameter
- ## Sample
	- A subset of the population
		- Getting in touch with a population of students, you have to pick a sample that is representative of your data.
			- E.g. randomly
- ## Sample Statistics
	- A numerical description of a sample character
		- E.g. Online Gaming
			- In 2017, made differences by age and gender

		- Parameter - look at the statement!

- # Statistics
	- ## Inferential
		- If you make a conjecture about where the data is sourced from - then the data is inferential
	- ## Descriptive
		- If the numbers, data, graphs and exists - then it is descriptive
	- ## Example:
		- **AOL had 900 journalists, 500 of them at its local patch news operation... By the end of 2013, Bloomberg expects to have 150 journalists and analysts for its new Washington operation**
		- Identify the *descriptive*, and *inferential* statistics used in this part of the article
			- **The information is descriptive** in the former half, "900 journalists, 500 of them, 2013, 150 journalists"
			- **The information is inferential** of "By the end of 150 journalists and analysts..."
