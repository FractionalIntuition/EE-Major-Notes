# 1. Measure of the center
## 1.1 Mean (Average)
If someone gives you a bunch of data, how do you find the mean? Are you dealing with the whole population? - or just a sample 
#### Sample Mean
- $\bar{x} = \frac{\Sigma x_i}{n}$; where i = 1
#### Population Mean
- $\mu = \frac{\Sigma x_i}{N}$
#### Weighted Mean
- In the previous cases, we're treating each of the data points equally. 
- $x_i$ has weight $w_i$
	- This has no meaning for now, we will focus on in chapter 4 or 5
- $\frac{\Sigma x_i * w_i}{\Sigma w_i} = \bar{x_w}$; for Sample
	- When $i = 1, 2, $
- $\bar{m_w}$ Sample population weighted mean
### Quiz Definition
The point on which a distribution would balance
## Median (Middle Value)
- Order data
- And the middle value
If its an odd-count, this'll be super easy
- Just take the center value
For even-count, it'll be the average between the two middle value
## Mode (Most Frequent Data Point)
- Nones
- Unit modal
- Multi-mode
## Ex: Given the following data-set:
8, 9, 10, 12, 4, 3, 5, 7, 10.
### Mean
$\bar{x} = \frac{\Sigma x}{n} = \frac{68}{9} = 7.\overline{555}$
### Median
8, when re-ordering the values:
3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 , 10, 10, 12 
- (Odd!)
### Mode
10
- Most common value
