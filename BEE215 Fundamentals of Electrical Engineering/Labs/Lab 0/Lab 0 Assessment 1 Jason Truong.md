### 1. What is the resistor color code for 57.6k Ohm Resistor @ 1% tolerance?
**Green, Violet, Blue, Brown, Brown**
### 2. The circuit calculations require a 34.7 kâ„¦ 1% resistor.
#### i) What is the closest value in the E96 column in the resistor table?
**40.2K Ohm Resistor: Yellow, Black, Red, Red, Brown**
#### ii) If an exact value is needed, what two resistors from your parts kit can be used in series?
**24.9K Ohm Resistor: Red, Yellow, White, Brown, Brown**
**9.09K Ohm Resistor: White, Black, White, Brown, Brown**
#### iii) Place these two resistors in series and state the range of resistance this series circuit can have based on your 1% tolerance.
**33.642K - 34.3299K Ohms**
#### iv) Measure the series resistance with your ohmmeter to 4 digits of precision and then state the values this resistance can have based on the accuracy of the ohmmeter.
**Measured Value: 33.91K Ohms**
**Tolerance: 0.235%**
**Range: 34.057K - 33.92202K Ohms**
