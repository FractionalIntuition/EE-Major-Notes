## Homework 4- 1
 ![[Pasted image 20240711162008.png]]
a)
- Bounded; integrates into 1
- Not causal
c)
- $cos(t)$; absolute value of impulse function over an infinite time is not bounded. Not BIBO
	- $\pi$ is positive
	- $\frac{\pi}{2}$ is negative
- Not causal
	- Because it is periodic function
f)
- Not bound
- Not causal; it's always 1
	- Does not have a cause; no dependence
