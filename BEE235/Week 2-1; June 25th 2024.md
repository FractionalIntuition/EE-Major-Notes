Continuation of Week 1-2; June 20th 2024

# Systems with memory
If the system has a dependency of time; in any modification of $x(t_o)$, it's **Memory**.
If it has dependencies of inputs other than $x(t_o)$, it is **Memoryless**

# Time-invariance
System -> Time Shift
or
Time Shift -> System

## If System and Time-shift no changes either direction; Time Invariant
## If System and then Time-shift; has change. Time Variant
## We typically focus on time shift; because it's in the definition: Invariance
If they don't have the linearity and linear and time-invariant LTI system; then it cannot commit to the convolution system.

# Linearity
Two conditions must be satisfied: *Additivity*, and *Homogeneity or Scaling*
Combination of both are the Superposition Condition (weighted sum):

Essentially, meaning additive and multiplicative of the signal's magnitude.

So in laymens:
If you add first, then multiply
The result should be the same as multiplying then adding
