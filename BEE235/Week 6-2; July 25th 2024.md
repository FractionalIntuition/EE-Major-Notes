# Eigenvalues
Any exponential term;
$e^{st}*h(t)=\int$

# Approximations within' the fourier coefficients
For functions we cannot make approximations;

$k\neq:\int^{T}_{0}$
Using this idea, in a general term, we find out what $C_k$ could be, and for the right hand side right here, in which the right-handside is non-zero when $k=n$ . That means we have those values in those type-series when $k=n$, so that is when it becomes one term.

$C_nT_0$, as for the input signal of the periodic functino x(t) $C_n=\frac{1}{T_0}$

And for the examples, over the periodic square wave forms, we integrate the amplitude; the relevant part - in which we integrate over the $C_k$ terms. In such, we see the spike.

# Conditions of Fourier Series
LTI system
The $C_k$ is defined by the integration fo $C_n=\frac{1}{t_0}\int^{T_0}_0x(t)e^{-jnw_0t}dt$
Must be bounded, exist and converges.: $e^{-jnw_0t}$, this value is typically coverging into $C_n$, which we find in the integration of $C_n$ to x(t).
1) x(t) is continuous
2) $\int_T|x(t)|^2=dt<\infty$

LTI System analysis;
$Xe^{s_1t}=aH(jkw_0)e^{jkw_0t}$, the eigen value of the fourier series of the LTI system of the fourier series with the periodic function, the summation of the LTI system $h(t)$. Directly we variate the values.

Very quickly he finds the result, and the terms of the integration of the fourier series of th esummation, that allows us to make use of the LTI H(t) series fo the summation, which is a "powerfula nd convenient method". And as acting as the last exercise, we look at the low-pass filter essentially which 

# Today's Lesson
Fourier Transform, the inclusive of a signal that is periodic, and we see what we can use to translate into the fourier series in the frequency domain.

We're looking at the continuous time fourier transformation of f(t), $F(\omega)=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}e^{jkw_0t}dt$

In the Fourier transform, we're looking at frequency domain; so we let the periodic function let it go to infinity, while still bounded BIBO BIBO BIBO BIBO BIBO BIBO BIBO BIBO BIBO BIBO BIBO.

The fourier Transformation is a continuous signal of the Frequency Dmomain of the continuous coefficient. As the fourier series.

The spike, which we identify from $C_k$ vs $kw_0t$. In reference to $T_0=\frac{2\pi}{w_0}$

$\Delta \omega_0$=$\omega_2-\omega_1=\frac{2\pi}{T_0}-{2\pi}{T_0}$
If we let $\Delta\omega_0$  go to $\infty$.

$T_0=\frac{\Delta\omega_0}{2\pi}=\frac{1}{\Delta T_0}$

# Analysis + Synthesis
The integration we find is just what we're supposedly given in the problem.

Fourier Transform: $F(\omega_0)=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f(t)e^{-j\omega_0t}dt$
Inverse Fourier Transform: $f(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}F(\omega)e^{j\omega_0t}d\omega$
