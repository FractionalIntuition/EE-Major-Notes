# BJT; Bipolar Junction Transistor
## Two types of BJT Transistors
![[Pasted image 20240807084925.png]]
P-Type: Silicon -> Boron Positive Charge Carriers
- $N_A$ higher, many holes.
N-Type: 
- $N_D$ higher, many donated electrons.
  
**NPN Transistors**

- In the region of the N-type, you would like to see the great amount of electrons
- In the region of the P-type, you would see a great amount of holes compared to the E, C
From the N-type, to the Base; the difference is a saturation.

# Diffusion Vs Drift
# Diffusion
## The particle moves when there's a concentric gradient regardless of constraint; so long as there's enough space for the particle to move. It is naturally moving from a higher gradient to a lower gradient.

The occurrence above is a level of diffusion that moves the gradients of electrons - creating a consequence of electric current being conducted across the two nodes.

# Drift Process
# Creating a electric field

Bi-polar
- Consequentially the electric field that is created form the higher and lower potential is created from a diode function that is carried out by mostly electrons.
# Review; brief

Diodes being on and voltage dropping - so long as the total series voltage in series continues to carry the diode in a forward-bias.
### Equivalency

# Relationship from Base to Collector
![[Pasted image 20240807091623.png]]
## Creation of a reverse bias between the diode of $C->B$
The design of the diode relationship is propagating an electric field between the n-type collector to the p-type emitter.

## Direction of electrons moving from the Base to Collector
![[Pasted image 20240807091940.png]]
Becuase of the electric field; the electrons move in the opposite direction of where the field flows - emitting a response known as "emission" of photons.

# NPN BJT Equations
$I_E=I_B+I_C$
$I_C=I_se^{\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T}}$
$I_C\propto I_B$ & $I_C>I_B$

The "More" forward-bias the fields become, the more weakened the barrier becomes; which means we also decrease the current for $I_{BC}$.
