# Metal Oxide Semiconductor

When referencing a semiconductor; there are two types.
N-type of semiconductor follow the logic that there are more electrons (-) than holes (+)
P-type of semiconductor suggests to the extra set of holes (+)

Mobile charge carrier.
$i=\frac{dQ}{dt}$.
The material of semiconductors are commonly.

**N-Type Silicone** Semiconductors are mobile distributed instead of a oxide layer at a distance away from a metal layer that has negative potential. Similar to like a capacitor's construction, except inbetween; there is an oxide cloud with an electron cloud remaining mobile between the two.

**P-Type Silicone Semiconductor**, similar to the N-Type semiconductor; except the holes of the oxide; metal layer are-of a high abundance of holes.

# Field Effect Transistors
Over a bi-polar differences of two plates; one layer a metal-oxide layer, and the other; an n-type layer, the p-type "nodes" along the layer alongside the metal-oxide side.

A diode; for example, has two halves of - the P-type and N-type. Anytime there is a polarity difference of an N-type and P-type MOS; there will be the properties of a diode. The negative-type material is  asubstrate body, and the Metal-Oxide portion is called a gate, the P-type of the left-hand & right-hand are called "Drain" & "Source" respectively.

The only relevant current is from P-type to N-type. The characteristics diode; semiconductor are found inbetween the P-type Drain + Source to a N-type substrate.

In the oxide canal within' the metal, there is a channel; the connection of current between source and drain. Threshhold voltage; (negative voltage source across metal), is the minimum threshold to propagate a channel. $V_{TH,N}<0$ 

When the charge carrier is created; the PMOSFET is made. Which in-turn will attract electrons.

**To do the opposite to create NMOSFET**, it's essentially the entire same structure, except all polarities are reversed. Except with the threshhold voltage is now a positive voltage. $V_{TH,P}>0$

For 3 pin MOSFET explains all the above of a **Field Effect Transistor**. The threshhold voltage of their respective voltages will determine.
$V_{,N}<0$
