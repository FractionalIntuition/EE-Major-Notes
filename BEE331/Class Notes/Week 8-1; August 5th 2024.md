# Intrinsic Si
![[Pasted image 20240805083618.png]]
Definition:
Purest form of a semiconductor. Only silicone

Understanding it is at a 99% Silicone Activity
![[Pasted image 20240805083836.png]]
## Covalent Bonds
A Silicone Atom has a total of 14 electrons
![[Pasted image 20240805083717.png]]
The relevant electrons of the outside of the silicone atom are the valence shell.
![[Pasted image 20240805084120.png]]
### Conductance
There is an electric field here, that is consequence of the current that flows through the copper.
![[Pasted image 20240805083926.png]]
Now, if you pull all the voltages here, and the current flows - it conducts.
### Density of Silicone Si
Si density is around $5*10^{22}/cm^3$

## Temperature Dependence
If we heat the material through any means - the thermal energy is applied to the intrinsic Silicone.
The silicon after a certain threshold of thermal energy, the valence shell break the bonds of the electrons to from the silicon
![[Pasted image 20240805084455.png]]
Denoted in red, the free electron.
Every silicon atom that is covalently bonded, slowly break apart further and further the electrons.
![[Pasted image 20240805084604.png]]
Consequentially, the Silicon losing an electron, it loses energy.

Meaning, that - after it lost its energy, and is no longer necessary to be captured by the protons - the electron has no need to return back to the silicon atom.

When those electrons lose energy - they emit that release as photons;
![[Pasted image 20240805084801.png]]
as a spectrum of light in electromagnetic radiation.
### Effects of temperature
- When above a certain threshold, the material is conductive after a heat
- When in room temperature, it just becomes a inductor
	- ### Room temperature: $23^\circ C + 273^\circ = 300K$
	- Even if we're not actively applying thermal energy to the material; room temperature is enough to break the covalent bonds on the valence shell.
	- Now we ask; "How many will be free?"
		- $e^-300K\approx5*10^{10}/cm^3$
		- The ratio being: $\frac{5*10^{10}/cm^3}{5*10^{22}/cm^3}$
	- Resistivity also depends on temperature
### Electrons in the movement of conducted electric field.
# "THAT WAY"
- Electrons move in the direction opposite of the path of the electric field.
# "THIS WAY"
- The conducted current moves in the same direction as the path of electric field.

### Electrons desire to feel complete
When electrons would attract/find/fill their empty valence shell spot - to try to rebalance themselves from being chemically unstable.
![[Pasted image 20240805090011.png]]
The electrons can often path their way back to an empty valence shell slot thanks to the direction of the electric field assisting in the movement - however; leads to having silicon electrons being stolen from those further up the path.
![[Pasted image 20240805090221.png]]
As an electron moves through the electric field, it dissipates a charge:
![[Pasted image 20240805090422.png]]
Electrons moving in the same path of the electric field have a positive charge. Electrons moving in the opposite path of the electric field have a negative charge.
![[Pasted image 20240805090441.png]]
So now, we refer to the holes in the valence shell now carrying a charge; of a net movement on the same direction towards the electric field.
![[Pasted image 20240805090602.png]]
So, we recognise that the $h^+$oles, contribute to the free-electrons inside the electric field.
![[Pasted image 20240805090732.png]]
Typically, we recognise that the movement of electrons inside a material experiencing intrinsic. We have an equal ratio of electron to holes.
## $n_i=n=p$
$n=p\approx5*10^{10}/cm^3=n_i$
$n_i$ number of charge carriers
- Not a representation of all charge carriers
$n:\#electrons/cm^3$
$p:\#holes/cm^3$
## Calculating Resistivity of a material
$R=\frac{V}{I}=\rho\frac{L}{A}$

### Relevance of Units
![[Pasted image 20240805091808.png]]
### Calculating Conductivity
$\sigma=\frac{1}{\rho}=q(n\mu_n+p\mu_p)$
- $n$, electrons
- $p$, holes
- $\mu$, mobility
	- $\mu_n$, mobility of electrons
	- $\mu_p$, mobility of holes
### How we define mobility
$\overrightarrow{v}=\mu\overrightarrow{E}$
For an electron, how fast we can move here.
### Which ones move faster?
Properties of electrons can easily move in the opposite direction of the electric field freely, and move between the polarities of low to high.
While holes require the presence of an open valence node in the silicon to mobilise.
So it should be stated, that electrons move faster than holes.
### So, calculating conductivity
If we know the values of electrons, holes, and their mobilities, you can calculate the $\sigma$ conductivity of a material.
## $n*p=n_i^2$
A typically famous equation of physical sciences.
It would hold $n_i^2$ many free-charge carriers.
### Even though @ room temperature
Even if the material's holes and electrons are happening of $5*10^{10}/cm^3$ silicon for room temperature. The current is insignificant.
# Extrinsic Si
How would we keep the material consistently conductive? - And how will we maintain a continuous conductivity through multiple ranges of temperature; having thermal energy being negligible as a result.

### Starting from the intrinsic level
![[Pasted image 20240805093237.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240805093318.png]]
It almost seems like that phosphorous donates an extra electron to the intrinsic level.
![[Pasted image 20240805093447.png]]
Electrons are added into the density of electrons per addition of phosphorous atoms.
### Regardless if Intrinsic or Extrinsic: $n*p=n_i^2$
Number of electrons to number of holes should conclusively equally to total charge carriers.
**Doping Process**, is when you replace a silicon atom with something else; and becomes an extrinsic semiconductor.

# Lightly Doped @ $10^{12}$

# Realising, above
## Large amount of $N_D$ to $P(h^+)$
As the material has a greater number of electrons to holes - by an order of 4.

# N-type
More electrons than holes.
$N>P,n\approx N_D => n*p=n_i^2$
# P-type
More holes than electrons.
$P>N,P\approx N_A => n*p=n_i^2$

The generated electrons generated from two sources;
The electron hole-pair generation from the Intrinsic and the Extrinsic.
- The intrinsic silicon.
- The donated electrons; extrinsic are more dominant.

There are no donated holes. So the holes that are present are consequential from the intrinsic hole-pair generations.
![[Pasted image 20240805095605.png]]
### Now if we change the temperature
The charge carriers that are effective are the intrinsic covalent bonds that are affected the most.
$\sigma=q(n\mu_n+p\mu_p)$
- $n=10^{12}$
- $p=10^8$
The doping process, doesn't depend on the temperature. The conductivity will not change - and as a result, is not-as temperature sensitive.

## Ultimate Rule:
### Semiconductive material < $\sigma$ < Metals
![[Pasted image 20240805100044.png]]
# P-Type Semiconductors
![[Pasted image 20240805100745.png]]
The synthetization of P-type Semiconductor, the empty hole form the pair that forms from the empty pair-hole $h^+$ empty-side silicon to boron relation produces a chemically reaction that is ready to accept electrons - simply called an "acceptor" $N_A$

### Depletion REgion
![[Pasted image 20240805102759.png]]
The charge build-up consequentially creates a potential difference of $-V+$ only along the interface; and current is equating to 0. Such that, $i=\frac{dQ}{dt}$, charge cannot travel over time. So there is exchanges of electrons.
![[Pasted image 20240805102923.png]]
Which then synthesises a **Depletion Region**
Entailing that the region signifies a depletion of free electrons for it to travel across the two materials in the semiconductor

In order for it to conduct, requires.
